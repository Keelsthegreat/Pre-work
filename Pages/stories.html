        <p> I love Undertale and Stardew Valley because they were both created by game developers by themselves as
            passion
            projets. It started off as something small and they themselves were surprised at how successful their games
            became. I especially like undertale because of how many outcomes the game has and how the smallest thing can
            determine the whole storymode.</p>

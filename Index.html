    <p id="intro"> My name is Akili Inniss, I'm 24 years old and I love Undertale. I started this tech journey
        because I love games. Undertale has really impacted me and my decision to pursue tech as a career. I met some
        people who have told me about the field. I love how this tech field is
        everchanging because I like to learn new things and I geniunely have an interest in learning about the many
        things tech has to offer!</p>

    <ol id="listfav">
        <li>Steven Universe</li>

        <li>Stardew Valley</li>
        <div id="why">
            <p> Steven Universe has been one of my favorite shows since I was a kid. I think it had a great message and
                has
                a really good soundtrack.</p>
            <p>Undertale also has a really good soundtrack.</p>
            <p>Stardew is a really fun and relaxing game. I could play for hours.</p>
